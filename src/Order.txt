1. Fundamental Building Blocks:
-------------------------------
Arrays: Understand initialization, access, traversal, searching, and sorting.
Linked Lists: Grasp the concepts of singly and doubly linked lists, and their operations.

2. Essential Data Structures:
-----------------------------
Stacks and Queues: Implement them using arrays or linked lists and understand their applications.
Recursion: Master writing recursive functions and understand base cases and stack overflow.

3. Core Data Structures:
------------------------
Binary Search: Learn this efficient search algorithm that works on sorted arrays and halves the search space with each iteration.
Trees: Understand different tree types (binary trees, n-ary trees), basic operations, and applications.

4. Advanced Data Structures (Build upon previous knowledge):
------------------------------------------------------------
Graphs: Build upon your knowledge of trees and understand graph concepts (adjacency lists/matrices, traversal algorithms), and applications.
Tries: Understand trie operations (insertion, searching) and their applications.

5. Specialized Data Structure:
------------------------------
Strings: Learn basic string manipulation methods, formatting, and regular expressions for pattern matching.

6. Algorithmic Paradigm:
------------------------
Dynamic Programming: Understand the concept of overlapping subproblems and memoization to solve problems like Fibonacci sequence, longest common subsequence, etc.
